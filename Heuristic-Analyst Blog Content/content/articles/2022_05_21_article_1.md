Summary: Explaining variance and standard deviation, and coding it in Python

In this post I will explain how to calculate the variance and standard deviation, what they are, explain two common question which are mostly not clarified in school books/by teachers and also give away a Python code to calculate both.<br>

To quantify the variation of values to a mean, one can use the so-called “variance” and “standard deviation”.<br>

Before we jump into the formulas, I should explain the difference between population and sample:<br>
***Population***: the population is the entire group about which you want to draw conclusions.<br>
***Sample***: A sample is the specific group you are collecting data from in order to use it to draw conclusions about the characteristics of the population.<br />
(***Sidenote***: Therefore, with any sample, the collection methodology (also known as sampling) is also extremely important, because it should reflect the characteristics of the population)

**Population formula**:<br>
$$ \sum \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N} $$

**Sample formula**:<br>
$$ \sum \frac{(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N-1} $$

where:

- $x_i$ = Population/sample values
- $\bar{x}$ = Mean of all given $x$
- $N$ = Number/Amount of given $x$<br><br>

Graphically you can imagine this plot:<br>

In the example above you see the differences of different heights to the sample mean. Because we square the differences we also square the units, so we got cm². That is why we need the standard deviation, which is just the square root of the variance.

Standard deviation formula (for population and sample):<br>
$$ \sqrt{\text{Variance}} $$

Now you may ask: ***“Why are we not just sum up te absolute values?***” Good question.
**Answer**: Because it is. It was introduced into the world 100 years ago and is used as a basis for many more calculations and analyses.

Another frequently asked question: ***“Why is there a -1 in the variance sample formula and not in the poplation formula?***“
Also a very good question.
**Answer**: If you draw a sample S from a population P and calculate the variance S with different means and plot the variances for each mean (so you don’t use the mean of the sample S, but different means, lets say around the actual mean of S and mean of P), you will see that the variances form a curve, a parabola.<br>
The parabola will have a minimum and will rise on the left and right sides.<br>
The minimum of the parabola will be where the actual mean of the sample is – this is an important ovbservation.<br>
Since we know that S is a sample and the variance of S is an approximation of the variance of the population P, we know that the calculated variance of S (with the actual mean of S, which is the minimum as said before) is most likely not at the minimum, but higher.<br>
For this reason, we correct the population formula by ***“-1”*** to get a larger result that better approximates the variance value of population P.

        for x in x_values:

        x_mean /= n
    
        for x in x_values:
            squared_sum_x += (x-x_mean)**2

            return squared_sum_x/n
        elif popultion_or_sample == "sample":
            return squared_sum_x/(n-1)
