Summary: Explaining Newton’s method, how it works and coding it in Python

In this post I will shortly explain what Newton’s method is and how it works.

**What is it:**

- Newton’s method is an algorithm to find zeropoints of a function
- Because you cannot always calculate the exact zeropoint we can use this algorithm to approximate the zeros of the function<br><br>

**How does it work:**

1. Start at a random $\text{point }A$ of the function
2. Calculate the $\text{tangent }T$ at this $\text{point }A$
3. Calculate the intersection between the $\text{x-axis}$ and the $\text{tangent }T$
4. Take the $\text{x-value}$ of the intersection point ($\text{x-axis}$ and the $\text{tangent }T$), calculate the $\text{y-value}$ ($f(x)$)  → new $\text{point }B$ at $(x|y)$ → becomes $\text{point }A$
5. Repeat the steps 2 - 4 (*like +500 times*) → approximation of the zeropoint<br><br>

***Important sidenote***:<br>
You should try to start with a nearby point to the actual zeropoint, because it might be that you would get a solution which is just wrong. This might be the case if you would get to a point with the slope of a tangent being 0, which does not have one intersection point with the x-axis (saddle point).

**Interesting fact – Approximate square root numbers**:<br>
With this approximation we can also calculate/approximate square roots, like $\sqrt{2}$ (irrational number).
To calculate the square root of 2 with Newton’s method we would first create a function (polynomial) where $f(\sqrt{2})$ = 0 (zeropoint at $\sqrt{2}$).

**How to achive this**:

$$
\begin{align}
x &= \sqrt{2}    && |^{2} \\
x^{2} &= 2       && |– 2 \\
x^{2} – 2 &= 0 \\
f(x) &= x^{2} – 2
\end{align}
$$

**Step by step math for Newton’s method**:

1. Start at $\text{point }A$ and calculate the slope
2. linear function is $y = m \cdot x + b$ → we got $m$ (the calculated slope) and the $\text{point }A$ throught which the line goes → calculate $b$: $b = y - (m \cdot x)$
3. To calculate the intersection of the tangent and the $\text{x-axis}$ set $y$ to $0$: $0 = m \cdot x + b$ → we got $m$ and $b$, so we need to calculate $x$ → $x = \frac{y - b}{m} = \frac{0 - b}{m}$
4. Calculate the new $\text{point }B$ of the function with $f(x)$ and repeat the steps

    :::python

    def newtons_method(iterations:int):
        x = 2
    
        for i in range(iterations):
            y = function_one(x)
            m = function_one_derivative(x)
            b = y-(m*x)
            x=(0-b)/m
        return x
 

    def function_one(x:float):
        return x**2-2
    
    
    def function_one_derivative(x:float):
        return 2*x
    
    print(newtons_method(5))
