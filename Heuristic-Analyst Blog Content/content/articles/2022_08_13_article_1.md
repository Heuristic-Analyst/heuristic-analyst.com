Summary: Create a simple, primitive text generator using Markov Chains

Today I would like to create a simple, primitive text generator using Markov chains (I explained them in a [previous post]({filename}/articles/2022_08_12_article_1.md)).

Necessary steps for this project:

1. Get text to learn from
2. Create the transition matrix
3. Generate text

I will do everything from scratch, but I will a library called “tqdm” to show a progress bar of a for loop.

# Get text to learn from:

First we need to get data. I will use Wikipedia to mine free text data. The output will be a *.txt* file with the text as one big string – I will not go into much detail here since it is not the main topic of this post. I will use the Wikipedia pages of *Psychology, Philosophy and Sigmund_Freud*:<br>

    :::python
    # Import package
    from urllib.request import urlopen
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import re
    from tqdm import tqdm
    
    def downloadWikiText(urls):
        text = ''
        for url in tqdm(urls):
            # Specify url of the web page
            source = urlopen(url).read()
            # Make a soup
            soup = BeautifulSoup(source,'lxml')
            # Extract the plain text content from paragraphs
            for paragraph in soup.find_all('p'):
                text += paragraph.text
    
            # Clean text
            text = re.sub(r'\[.*?\]+', '', text)
            text = text.replace('\n', '')
            # Append space for next text
            text += " "
        # Remove last " " and then save text as a file
        text = text[:-1]
        with open('wiki_text.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(text)
    
    urls = ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology",
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy",
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud"]
    downloadWikiText(urls)

Now the text is saved in “*./wiki_text.txt*”.

# Create the transition matrix:

The following code will the these steps:

1. Open wiki_text.txt and save text in a variable
2. delete every non-alphanumeric symbol and convert string text to a list with each word as an element of the text (all words will be lowercase)
3. Create a list will all unique words
4. Create the transition matrix which will be a square matrix with the length of the unique words list
5. Iterate through the wiki text:
    1. Find current word
    2. Find next word
    3. Add the occurence of the transition (from current to next word) to the transition matrix by adding 1 to the corresponding cell
6. Since the probability of all next words from the current word should be 1 -> divide transition matrix rows by its sum
7. Save unique words and corresponding transition matrix

    :::python
    import re
    from tqdm import tqdm
    
    # open text file with gathered wiki text
    with open('wiki_text.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        text = f.read()
    
    # get only words out of it - replaces all symbols like !,? etc...
    # first substitute every non-alphanumeric character with " ", then:
    # if double, triple, ... spaces exist just replace them with one space, afterwards split text into a list
    text = re.sub(" +", " ", re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z0-9]", " ", text)).split(" ")
    # delete all "" in list
    text = list(filter(lambda a: a != "", text))
    # make every word lowercase
    text = [x.lower() for x in text]
    # get every word one time and sort the list alphabetically
    unique_words = sorted(list(set(text)))
    
    # create transition matrix - square matrix
    transition_matrix = [[0 for j in range(len(unique_words))] for i in range(len(unique_words))]
    # add each occurrence of state transition into the transition matrix
    for i in tqdm(range(len(text)-1)):
        # current word in text (index in unique word list)
        current_state = unique_words.index(text[i])
        # next word in text (index in unique word list)
        future_state = unique_words.index(text[i+1])
        # add 1 to state transition in matrix
        transition_matrix[current_state][future_state] += 1
    
    # divide each row by the sum of each row
    for i in tqdm(range(len(transition_matrix))):
        if text[-1] != unique_words[i]:
            sum_row = 0
            for number_of_occurrences in transition_matrix[i]:
                sum_row += number_of_occurrences
            for j in range(len(transition_matrix[i])):
                transition_matrix[i][j] /= sum_row
    
    # save unique words and transition matrix
    with open('unique_words.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(str(unique_words))
    with open('transition_matrix.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(str(transition_matrix))

# Generate text:

The following code will do these steps:

1. Open unique words list and transition matrix list/array – both as a string
2. Convert both string lists to actual lists with the “json” library
3. Set a starting phrase/word and number of words as well as number of sentences to be generated
4. Create loop for each sentence:
    1. Create loop for each word:
        1. get current state
        2. get to next state by random choice with probability distribution from transition matrix
        3. add word to sentence
        4. set next state to current state
        5. Repeat until number of words and number of sentences are generated
5. Print sentences – will differ every time

    :::python
    import json
    import random
    from tqdm import tqdm
    
    # open unique words and calculated transition matrix
    with open('unique_words.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        unique_words = f.read()
    with open('transition_matrix.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        transition_matrix = f.read()
    
    # convert string representation of list to actual list using json.loads()
    unique_words = json.loads(unique_words.replace("'", '"'))
    print("Unique words:", len(unique_words))
    transition_matrix = json.loads(transition_matrix)
    
    # generate random text by giving a start word (must be included in the training text)
    starting_phrase = "Sigmund Freud"
    length_of_sentences = 20    # words
    number_of_sentences = 10
    # get "Freud" as the starting word
    start_word = starting_phrase.split(" ")[-1]
    current_word = start_word.lower()
    sentences = [starting_phrase.lower() for i in range(number_of_sentences)]
    for i in tqdm(range(number_of_sentences)):
        for j in range(length_of_sentences):
            current_state = unique_words.index(current_word)
            try:
                next_state = random.choices(unique_words, transition_matrix[current_state])[0]
                current_word = next_state
                sentences[i] += " " + current_word
            except:
                break
    for i in range(len(sentences)):
        print(str(i+1)+". sentence:", sentences[i])

    :::python
    # Output
    Unique words: 6402

    2. sentence: sigmund freud ego it was cremated at johns hopkins university led to one independent variable at golders green crematorium s sense philosophy

As you can see the sentences do not make sense, but their grammar is mostly correct though. A very good outcome, considering we only worked with 6402 unique words!

This was a first step into understanding NLP. As always the code can be found here on my github [(www.github.com/Heuristic-Analyst/…)](https://github.com/Heuristic-Analyst/heuristic-analyst.com/tree/main/Markov%20Chains%20-%20NLP). Cheers!
