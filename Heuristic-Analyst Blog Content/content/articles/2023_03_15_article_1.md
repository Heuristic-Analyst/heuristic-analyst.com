Summary: Explaining and implementing dynamic time warping (DTW)

Hello, today I will shortly explain what dynamic time warping (DTW) is and show you my code implementation of it.

What is it:<br>
Lets say you got 2 signal that are the same. The difference between them though might be in length (one is more streched then the other) or/and in phase (same high of the signal in time series one might be slightly shifted to the right or left in signal 2). Lets look at this example:<br>

We can use DTW to match these two signals:<br>

If you want to know how the algorithm works, check out this wonderful Youtube video. I implemented it in Python:<br>

    :::python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    
    
    def dtw(ts1, ts2):
        n, m = len(ts1), len(ts2)
        dtw_cost_matrix = np.zeros((n + 1, m + 1))
        dtw_trace_matrix = np.zeros((n + 1, m + 1))
        dtw_path = []
        for i in range(n + 1):
            for j in range(m + 1):
                dtw_cost_matrix[i, j] = np.inf
                dtw_trace_matrix[i, j] = np.inf
        dtw_cost_matrix[0, 0] = 0
        dtw_trace_matrix[0, 0] = 0
    
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                cost = abs(ts1[i - 1] - ts2[j - 1])
                last_min = np.min([dtw_cost_matrix[i - 1, j - 1], dtw_cost_matrix[i - 1, j], dtw_cost_matrix[i, j - 1]])
                # 0 from diagonal before - 1 from above - 2 from left
                from_where = np.argmin([dtw_cost_matrix[i - 1, j - 1], dtw_cost_matrix[i - 1, j], dtw_cost_matrix[i, j - 1]])
                dtw_cost_matrix[i, j] = cost + last_min
                dtw_trace_matrix[i, j] = from_where
    
        while True:
            if n == 0 and m == 0:
                break
            else:
                dtw_path.append((n - 1, m - 1))
                if dtw_trace_matrix[n, m] == 0:
                    n, m = n - 1, m - 1
                elif dtw_trace_matrix[n, m] == 1:
                    n, m = n - 1, m
                else:
                    n, m = n, m - 1
        dtw_path = dtw_path[::-1]
        return dtw_cost_matrix, dtw_path
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Define the two time series
        x = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0])
        y = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -0.5, 0, 0])
    
        # Perform dynamic time warping
        # cost matrix and the path (tuple is matched indices in time series 1 and 2)
        cost_matrix, dtw_path = dtw(x, y)
    
        plt.plot(x)
        # Shifting signal y to illustrate the connections made by DTW
        plt.plot(y-2)
        for i in range(len(dtw_path)):
            plt.plot([dtw_path[i][0], dtw_path[i][1]], [x[dtw_path[i][0]], y[dtw_path[i][1]]-2], c="C7")
        plt.show()
