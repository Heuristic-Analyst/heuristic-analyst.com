Lookup the blogpost about this project.
I only included the wiki_text.txt I used (date: 13.08.2022).
The transition matrix is to big (200mb) to upload to github, which is why I did not include it with the unique words list here.
BUT: they both are replicable, so just run the modeling Python file and you got what you need!
