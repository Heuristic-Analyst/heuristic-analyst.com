 - Same data as the versions before - but better coding (see example data)
 - How to use it:
	- to download cik mapping run ./downloadAndProcessCiks_Folder/downloadAndProcessCiks.js (change parameters in this file and the json in the same folder)
	- to download submissions data run ./downloadAndProcessSubmissions_Folder/downloadAndProcessSubmissions.js (accepts tickers, titles and ciks - change them in the file down below)

 - This coding is perfect for a bigger project, that is why I changed it
