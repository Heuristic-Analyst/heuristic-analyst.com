How to use:
1. First download official CIK-Ticker-Title mapping by running ./downloadAndProcessCiks_Folder/downloadAndProcessCiks.js
2. Download submission files by running ./downloadAndProcessSubmissions_Folder/downloadAndProcessSubmissions.js
 - Now you established the database to search every filing SEC got about a company
3. You can download now every filing you want by running ./downloadForms_Folder/downloadForms.js

If you want to change what exactly to download (forms, companies) you can change the arguments in each of these files.
The params JS and JSON are there to create a parameter object to download and save the files correctly
