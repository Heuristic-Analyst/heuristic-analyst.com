I wanted a program that records what I was saying and can output it as text (Speech to Text / Transcribe).
I used the whisper model(s) (through faster-whisper) for it and run them on a cpu.
Audio capturing is done with pyaudio.

Because I am using whisper, i can also translate everything into english.
I also included the python script so you can see how I have done it (with GUI).

I then converted it for portability reasons into 2 .EXE files, one with the base model, one with the medium model.
I wanted to upload it but the one application is 360MB and the other about 2.3GB, and Github doesn't allow me to upload it.
--> If you want it to convert by yourself, good luck, because I used virtual enviroments throughout this project and the model is an extern folder, I needed to 
    somehow hook something and do other stuff, finding dlls and more. I got it only to work because I uploaded the script to claude.ai and asked it how to do it lol, so do the same
